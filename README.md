# Algorithms

What follows here are Typescript implementations of common algorithms. There isn't anything special about
these algorithms, some were tackled when I was learning Typescript, others were developed for specific use cases. I am
not going to claim they are the best implementations, or the most efficient - all I will say that for my needs, they
were sufficient.

Included here are:

  - Graphs (Undirected Adjacency)
  - Heaps (Min, Max Binary and D*ry)
  - Linked Lists (Single and Double)
  - Object Diffing 
  - Queues (FIFO, Priority Min & Max)
  - Sorts (Bubble, Heap, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Radix, Selection)
  - Stacks (Generic, Undo/Redo)
  - Trees (Binary Search Tree)

One note - wherever appropriate, I've made use of **generic types**. More fun that way.
